Building compy should be extremely straightforward.

Dependencies:
    - A C compiler.
    - Python 3.
    - Numpy.

Run ./build.sh to build the python extension.

Examples for how to use compy can be found in the compy_examples.py script. The document in theory_dec explains some of the relevant physics.
